SUMMARY

Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics is used to summarize data and make sense out of the raw data collected. Since the data usually represents a sample, then the descriptive statistics 
is a quantitative description of the sample.The level of measurement of the data affects the type of descriptive statistics.
Nominal and ordinal type data (often termed together as categorical type data) will differ in the analysis from interval and ratio type data (often termed together as continuous type data).

Descriptive statistics for categorical data
Frequency tables are used to tabulate categorical data. A frequency table shows a matrix or table between independent variables at the top row versus a dependent variable on the left column, with the cells indicating the frequency of occurrence of possible combination of levels.

Descriptive statistics for continuous data
The central tendency and variability of the data are the two aspects of descriptive statistics used for continuous type data.

Measures of central tendency "refers to a number (statistic) that best characterizes the group as a whole. It is generally referred to as the average. The three types of averages are:
1. The MEAN (M): is the arithmetic average (sum of all score divided by the number of
cases)
2. The MEDIAN (Mdn): is the midpoint of a distribution of data. Half the scores fall
above and half below the median.
3. The MODE: is the single score that occurs most often in a distribution of data.

Point Estimates and Interval Estimates
A point estimate is a single value (statistic) used to estimate a population value
(parameter).
A confidence interval is a range of values within which the population parameter is
expected to occur.
The factors that determine the width of a confidence interval are:
1. The sample size, n.
2. The proportion or variability in the population.
3. The desired level of confidence.
? An interval estimate states the range within which a population parameter probably lies.
? The interval within which a population parameter is expected to occur is called a confidence interval.
? The two confidence intervals that are used extensively are the 95% and the 99%.
? For a 95% confidence interval, about 95% of the similarly constructed intervals will
? contain the parameter being estimated. Also 95% of the sample means for a specified
? sample size will lie within 1.96 standard deviations of the hypothesized population mean.
? For the 99% confidence interval, 99% of the sample means for a specified sample size will lie within 2.575 standard deviations of the hypothesized population mean.

Coefficient of Correlation(r)
Pearson’s coefficient of correlation is used to draw an association between two variables. It is denoted by ‘r’.
The value of r ranges between +1 to -1.
The coefficient of correlation is used to identify whether there is a positive association, negative association or no association between two variables.
When the value is 0, it indicates that there is no association between two variables. When it is less than 0, it indicates a negative association,
and when the value is more than 0, then it indicates a positive association.
